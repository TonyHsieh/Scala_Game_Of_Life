ScalaFX Ensemble
================

ScalaFX Ensemble show cases various controls that have been implemented in scalaFX. Each control
displays a running example and code. We believe ScalaFX Ensemble could help beginners or adopters 
of ScalaFX to get inspired to start building apps. This project is inspired from JavaFX Ensemble.
